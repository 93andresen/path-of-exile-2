The terminal is bash (even though it may say something else somewhere in my enviorment details or somewhere...)

# Terminal Output

If the assistant doesen't see a command's output, it usually means the terminal was starting up - the command still ran successfully and the user can see the output. All subsequent commands in that terminal will be visible to the assistant.

The startup problem was often caused by conda and I usually don't use conda anymore... Also the problem has been adressed in recent updates so maybe it's fixed.

If this happens twice in a row, your bash terminal settings migpreadht need checking. The setting that is tested and works for the assistant to see terminal output is:
`"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash"`

Since the user can always see the terminal output, Cline will only ask for output confirmation if:
1. The output is critical for the next step AND
2. There's no other way to verify the result (like using another command)

If it happens twice in a row, try to experiment a little with what will actually show you the output. I still am not sure about what causes it and it seems inconsistant, but once it works it usually continues to keep working.

One thing about the paths:
I have a folder named underscore in C:\ and all my files are in there so all my full paths starts with C:\_\
The folder name is something I will eventually get around to changing. But until I do, I need you to know about it because Large language models sometimes get the path wrong.
The python code should simply be written to work cross platform anyway so this should not really be a problem...
