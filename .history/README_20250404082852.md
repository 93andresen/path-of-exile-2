# Path of Exile 2 Early Access Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Start
If you're having trouble accessing PoE2 after purchasing a Supporter Pack, try these immediate steps:
1. Download the standalone client from [pathofexile.com/download](https://www.pathofexile.com/download)
2. Verify your Steam DLC list for PoE2 Early Access
3. Check for the "Dawn of the Hunt" league in-game

## Problem Summary
You purchased the $30 Early Access Supporter Pack for Path of Exile 2 via Steam, activated the key, and received MTX points, but cannot access PoE2 gameplay.

What's Already Confirmed:
- Purchased EA Supporter Pack via Steam
- Activated key in Steam
- Received MTX points in PoE account
- Steam and PoE account are linked
- Can launch Steam and the game, but unclear if it's PoE1 or PoE2
- No error messages appear

## Understanding the Issue
Common symptoms players experience:
- MTX points received but can't launch PoE2
- No separate PoE2 entry in Steam library
- Confusion about accessing "Dawn of the Hunt" content

Potential causes:
- **Unified Client:** PoE2 runs through PoE1's client
- **Content Lock:** PoE2 requires specific in-game navigation
- **Client Version:** Missing "Dawn of the Hunt" patch
- **Account Conflicts:** Steam linked to wrong PoE account

## Comprehensive Troubleshooting

### 1. Standalone Client Test
**Action:** Download standalone client from [pathofexile.com/download](https://www.pathofexile.com/download)  
**Why:** Steam version may not clearly indicate PoE2 access

### 2. Steam Verification
- Check Library → Path of Exile → Properties → DLC
- Confirm PoE2 Early Access is listed
- Launch correct version if multiple exist

### 3. In-Game Checks
- Look for "Dawn of the Hunt" league option
- Verify "Huntress" class availability
- Check for PoE2-specific UI elements

### 4. File Validation
Steam → Right-click Path of Exile → Properties → Verify files  
Ensures all game files are properly installed

### 5. Account Verification
Confirm Steam account is linked to correct PoE account at [pathofexile.com](https://www.pathofexile.com)
