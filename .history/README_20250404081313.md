# Path of Exile 2 Early Access Troubleshooting Guide

Having trouble accessing Path of Exile 2 Early Access after purchasing a Supporter Pack? This guide combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive troubleshooting process.

## Understanding the Issue

Many players encounter difficulties accessing PoE2 Early Access despite successfully purchasing and activating a Supporter Pack. Common symptoms include:

*   Receiving MTX points but not being able to launch PoE2.
*   Not seeing PoE2 as a separate game in the Steam library.
*   Being unsure how to access "Dawn of the Hunt" content.

Possible causes include:

*   **Unified Client:** PoE2 may launch through the same client as Path of Exile 1, requiring in-game navigation.
*   **In-Game Content Lock:** PoE2 content may be locked behind specific league or mode selections.
*   **Client Version:** The game client may not be updated to include the "Dawn of the Hunt" patch.
*   **Steam Account Conflicts:** Your Steam ID may be linked to an older or blank PoE account.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Follow these steps in order to resolve access issues:

1.  **Standalone Client Test (Critical):**
    *   Download the standalone PC client from the official Path of Exile website: [https://www.pathofexile.com/download](https://www.pathofexile.com/download)
    *   Log in with your email and password (NOT Steam).
    *   Determine if PoE2 appears more clearly or loads a different launcher experience.
    *   *Rationale:* The Steam version is not always clearly labeled as PoE2.

2.  **Steam Library Verification:**
    *   Check your Steam Library for "Path of Exile."
    *   Right-click → Properties → DLC → See if PoE2/Early Access is listed.
    *   Ensure you’re launching the correct version if multiple entries appear.
    *   *Rationale:* PoE2 may be hidden under PoE1's launcher or as DLC.

3.  **In-Game Navigation Exploration:**
    *   Launch the game.
    *   Check for an option to switch to PoE2 in the launcher.
    *   Check if you can create a new character under a new “league” or mode that seems different (e.g., “Dawn of the Hunt”).
    *   Check if you are seeing “The Huntress” class anywhere in character creation.
    *   *Rationale:* You may already be in PoE2, but the client does not clearly differentiate it from PoE1.

4.  **Game File Validation:**
    *   Steam → Right-click Path of Exile → Properties → Installed Files → Verify integrity.
    *   *Rationale:* Triggers necessary file updates for PoE2 content.

5.  **Steam Account Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Log in to [https://www.pathofexile.com](https://www.pathofexile.com) and double-check which account your Steam ID is associated with under “Linked Accounts.”
    *   *Rationale:* Your Steam ID may be linked to an older or blank PoE account.

6.  **Community Support:**
    *   Join the official or major PoE Discord communities:
        *   [Path of Exile Discord](https://discord.gg/pathofexile)
        *   Reddit: [r/pathofexile](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/)
    *   *Rationale:* Community members may have encountered similar issues.

7.  **GGG Support Escalation (If Needed):**
    *   Contact Grinding Gear Games: [https://www.pathofexile.com/support](https://www.pathofexile.com/support)
    *   Include:
        *   Steam transaction receipt
        *   Screenshot of Steam → Library → Path of Exile → DLC tab
        *   Screenshot of your “Manage Account” → “Linked Accounts” page
        *   Screenshot of your MTX points
    *   *Rationale:* Direct support from the developers is the final step.
